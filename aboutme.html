            <p>About Me</p>
            <br>
            <p>Web Development Student</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was born and raised in Hong Kong and after finishing
              highschool, I studied Physiotherapy but I realized that
              it wasn't for me and decided to go into Web Development.</p>
              <br>
            <p>Hobbies</p>
            <p>In my spare time I like meeting up with friends and
              playing basketball. I also enjoy hiking (only if it's
              relatively easy).
              Although I'm not good, while going on hikes I like taking
              photos of my friends and the scenery.</p>
              <br>
            <p>Why Bootcamp</p>
            <p>I decided to join the bootcamp because I felt that it
              was an amazing opportunity to do work in a field that I'm
              interested in. I especially like the fact that you will
              be learning something new every day and constantly
              increasing your knowledge </p>
