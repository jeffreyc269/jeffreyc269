# Personal Site

I wanted to make this site responsive without using a crutch such as Bootstrap. I felt that there would be a lot of time spent on trying to change the Bootstrap CSS to try and make it the way I wanted the website to look.

There is a carousel made from javascript that automatically changes slides after a few seconds or after pushing the next button.
